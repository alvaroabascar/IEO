You can upload figures to Overleaf via the Project menu. Upon acceptance, we'll ask for your figure files to be uploaded in any of the following formats: TIFF (.tiff), JPEG (.jpg), Microsoft PowerPoint (.ppt), EPS (.eps), or Adobe Illustrator (.ai). Images should be a minimum of 300 dpi in resolution and 500 dpi minimum if line art images. RGB, CMYK, and Grayscale are all acceptable.

Graph axes must be exactly perpendicular and all lines of equal density. Label multiple figure parts with A, B, etc. in bolded type, and use Arrows and numbers to draw attention to areas you want to highlight.
