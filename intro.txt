Glioblastoma multiforme is the most presented and aggressive brain tumor in humans, involving glial cells, with an incidence of 2â€“3 cases per 100,000 person life-years in Europe and North America ([Fonnet E. Bleeker, _et al_ (2012)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3337398/)).

Treatment can involve chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. Median survival with standard-of-care radiation and chemotherapy with the alkylating agent temozolomide is 15 months([Johnson, Derek R. _et al_ (2011)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11060-011-0749-4)) while the median survival without treatment is 4 and a half months. Regretfully glioblastomas are notorious for resistance to therapy, which has been attributed to DNA-repair proficiency, a multitude of deregulated molecular pathways, and, more recently, to the particular biologic behavior of tumor stem-like cells. Here, based on the reference work of [Murat, A. _et al_ (2008)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18565887), we aimed to identify the molecular profiles specific for treatment resistance to the current standard of care of concomitant chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide.

To achieve our goal, we take from the reference study a set of gene expression profiles of 80 glioblastomas of patients treated whithin clinical trials of concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide to radiotherapy (n=52) and patients treated with only radioterapy (n=28). In addition, 4 control patients were added to the study.
