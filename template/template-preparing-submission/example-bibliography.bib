abstract = {PURPOSE: Glioblastomas are notorious for resistance to therapy, which has been attributed to DNA-repair proficiency, a multitude of deregulated molecular pathways, and, more recently, to the particular biologic behavior of tumor stem-like cells. Here, we aimed to identify molecular profiles specific for treatment resistance to the current standard of care of concomitant chemoradiotherapy with the alkylating agent temozolomide. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Gene expression profiles of 80 glioblastomas were interrogated for associations with resistance to therapy. Patients were treated within clinical trials testing the addition of concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide to radiotherapy. RESULTS: An expression signature dominated by HOX genes, which comprises Prominin-1 (CD133), emerged as a predictor for poor survival in patients treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy (n = 42; hazard ratio = 2.69; 95\% CI, 1.38 to 5.26; P = .004). This association could be validated in an independent data set. Provocatively, the HOX cluster was reminiscent of a "self-renewal" signature (P = .008; Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) recently characterized in a mouse leukemia model. The HOX signature and EGFR expression were independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis, adjusted for the O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status, a known predictive factor for benefit from temozolomide, and age. Better outcome was associated with gene clusters characterizing features of tumor-host interaction including tumor vascularization and cell adhesion, and innate immune response. CONCLUSION: This study provides first clinical evidence for the implication of a "glioma stem cell" or "self-renewal" phenotype in treatment resistance of glioblastoma. Biologic mechanisms identified here to be relevant for resistance will guide future targeted therapies and respective marker development for individualized treatment and patient selection.},

abstract = {Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumor. Despite maximum treatment, patients only have a median survival time of 15 months, because of the tumor's resistance to current therapeutic approaches. Thus far, methylation of the O (6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter has been the only confirmed molecular predictive factor in glioblastoma. Novel "genome-wide" techniques have identified additional important molecular alterations as mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and its prognostic importance. This review summarizes findings and techniques of genetic, epigenetic, transcriptional, and proteomic studies of glioblastoma. It provides the clinician with an up-to-date overview of current identified molecular alterations that should ultimately lead to new therapeutic targets and more individualized treatment approaches in glioblastoma.},

abstract = {Cognitive dysfunction is a common manifestation of primary brain tumors. We evaluated the association between early cognitive dysfunction and prognosis in a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Ninety-one patients who completed neuropsychological assessment after tumor resection but before further treatment were identified in the MD Anderson Neuropsychology database. The relationship between performance on cognitive testing and survival was evaluated using not only Cox proportional hazards models that included clinical factors such as age and KPS but also the Kaplan-Meier method. Median survival time from surgery was 20.7 months. Rates of impairment on cognitive testing ranged from 7.1\% for Similarities, to 60.0\% for Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised Total Recall. As continuous variables, the Clinical Trial Battery Composite, Trail Making Test Part B, and Controlled Oral Word Association test were associated with survival. Impairment on the Trail Making Test Part B, Controlled Oral Word Association, Similarities, and Digit Span were associated with mortality. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated the survival impact of these tests on the group as a whole and in select patient subgroups defined by classification by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA). Cognitive impairment as measured by specific neuropsychological tests is independently associated with poor prognosis in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, and this effect remains significant even within patient subgroups defined by RTOG RPA class. Executive function and attention are the cognitive domains most closely associated with prognosis in this analysis.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Temozolomide is a novel oral alkylating agent with demonstrated efficacy as second-line therapy for patients with recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). This phase II study was performed to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of concomitant radiation plus temozolomide therapy followed by adjuvant temozolomide therapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-four patients were enrolled onto this open-label, phase II trial. Temozolomide (75 mg/m(2)/d x 7 d/wk for 6 weeks) was administered orally concomitant with fractionated radiotherapy (60 Gy total dose: 2 Gy x 5 d/wk for 6 weeks) followed by temozolomide monotherapy (200 mg/m(2)/d x 5 days, every 28 days for six cycles). The primary end points were safety and tolerability, and the secondary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: Concomitant radiation plus temozolomide therapy was safe and well tolerated. Nonhematologic toxicities were rare and mild to moderate in severity. During the concomitant treatment phase, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or both were observed in 6\% of patients, including two severe infections with Pneumocystis carinii. During adjuvant temozolomide, 2\% and 6\% of cycles were associated with grade 3 and 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, respectively. Median survival was 16 months, and the 1- and 2-year survival rates were 58\% and 31\%, respectively. Patients younger than 50 years old and patients who underwent debulking surgery had the best survival outcome. CONCLUSION: Continuous daily temozolomide and concomitant radiation is safe. This regimen of concomitant chemoradiotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy may prolong the survival of patients with glioblastoma. Further investigation is warranted, and a randomized trial is ongoing.},

abstract = {Microarray experiments are currently widely applied in many areas of biomedical research. The Affymetrix GeneChip® system is a commercial high-density oligonucleotide microarray platform which measures gene expression using hundreds of thousands of 25-mer oligonucleotide probes. This dissertation addresses how probe intensity data from GeneChips® are processed to produce gene expression values and shows how better pre-processing leads to gene expression measures, that after further analysis, yield biologically meaningful conclusions. An ideal expression measure is one which is both precise and accurate. A three-stage procedure for producing an expression measure is proposed. For each of the three stages, background correction, normalization and summarization, numerous methods are developed and assessed using spike-in datasets. Bias and variance criteria are used to compare the different methods of producing expression values. The methods are also judged by how well they correctly identify the differential genes. The background method has a significant effect on the bias, which is reduced, and the variability, which is usually increased. Non-linear normalization methods are found to reduce the non-biological variability between multiple arrays without introducing any significant bias. Robust multi-chip linear models are found to fit the data well and provide the recommended summarization method. The summarization methodology is extended to produce test statistics for determining differential genes. These test statistics perform favorably at correctly detecting differential genes when compared with alternative methods based on expression values. Finally, using case study data, no statistical benefit is found for using arrays hybridized with mRNA from a pool rather than from a single biological source. Professor},

abstract = {Quality of microarray gene expression data has emerged as a new research topic. As in other areas, microarray quality is assessed by comparing suitable numerical summaries across microarrays, so that outliers and trends can be visualized, and poor quality arrays or variable quality sets of arrays can be identified. Since each single array comprises tens or hundreds of thousands of measurements, the challenge is to find numerical summaries which can be used to make accurate quality calls. To this end, several new quality measures are introduced based on probe level and probeset level information, all obtained as a by-product of the low-level analysis algorithms RMA/fitPLM for Affymetrix GeneChips. Quality landscapes spatially localize chip or hybridization problems. Numerical chip quality measures are derived from the distributions of Normalized Unscaled Standard Errors and of Relative Log Expressions. Quality of chip batches is assessed by Residual Scale Factors. These quality assessment measures are demonstrated on a variety of datasets (spike-in experiments, small lab experiments, multi-site studies). They are compared with Affymetrix's individual chip quality report.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: When running experiments that involve multiple high density oligonucleotide arrays, it is important to remove sources of variation between arrays of non-biological origin. Normalization is a process for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations between arrays and the standard normalization provided by Affymetrix does not perform well in these situations. RESULTS: We present three methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level. These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably. AVAILABILITY: Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org.

abstract = {In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip system with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A GeneChip arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average (RMA) of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed PM values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.},

abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

    abstract = {It has unambiguously been shown that genetic, environmental, demographic, and technical factors may have substantial effects on gene expression levels. In addition to the measured variable(s) of interest, there will tend to be sources of signal due to factors that are unknown, unmeasured, or too complicated to capture through simple models. We show that failing to incorporate these sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on the study. Not only can this reduce power or induce unwanted dependence across genes, but it can also introduce sources of spurious signal to many genes. This phenomenon is true even for well-designed, randomized studies. We introduce "surrogate variable analysis" (SVA) to overcome the problems caused by heterogeneity in expression studies. SVA can be applied in conjunction with standard analysis techniques to accurately capture the relationship between expression and any modeled variables of interest. We apply SVA to disease class, time course, and genetics of gene expression studies. We show that SVA increases the biological accuracy and reproducibility of analyses in genome-wide expression studies.},
