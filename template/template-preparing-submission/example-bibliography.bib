abstract = {PURPOSE: Glioblastomas are notorious for resistance to therapy, which has been attributed to DNA-repair proficiency, a multitude of deregulated molecular pathways, and, more recently, to the particular biologic behavior of tumor stem-like cells. Here, we aimed to identify molecular profiles specific for treatment resistance to the current standard of care of concomitant chemoradiotherapy with the alkylating agent temozolomide. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Gene expression profiles of 80 glioblastomas were interrogated for associations with resistance to therapy. Patients were treated within clinical trials testing the addition of concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide to radiotherapy. RESULTS: An expression signature dominated by HOX genes, which comprises Prominin-1 (CD133), emerged as a predictor for poor survival in patients treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy (n = 42; hazard ratio = 2.69; 95\% CI, 1.38 to 5.26; P = .004). This association could be validated in an independent data set. Provocatively, the HOX cluster was reminiscent of a "self-renewal" signature (P = .008; Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) recently characterized in a mouse leukemia model. The HOX signature and EGFR expression were independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis, adjusted for the O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status, a known predictive factor for benefit from temozolomide, and age. Better outcome was associated with gene clusters characterizing features of tumor-host interaction including tumor vascularization and cell adhesion, and innate immune response. CONCLUSION: This study provides first clinical evidence for the implication of a "glioma stem cell" or "self-renewal" phenotype in treatment resistance of glioblastoma. Biologic mechanisms identified here to be relevant for resistance will guide future targeted therapies and respective marker development for individualized treatment and patient selection.},

abstract = {Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumor. Despite maximum treatment, patients only have a median survival time of 15 months, because of the tumor's resistance to current therapeutic approaches. Thus far, methylation of the O (6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter has been the only confirmed molecular predictive factor in glioblastoma. Novel "genome-wide" techniques have identified additional important molecular alterations as mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and its prognostic importance. This review summarizes findings and techniques of genetic, epigenetic, transcriptional, and proteomic studies of glioblastoma. It provides the clinician with an up-to-date overview of current identified molecular alterations that should ultimately lead to new therapeutic targets and more individualized treatment approaches in glioblastoma.},

abstract = {Cognitive dysfunction is a common manifestation of primary brain tumors. We evaluated the association between early cognitive dysfunction and prognosis in a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Ninety-one patients who completed neuropsychological assessment after tumor resection but before further treatment were identified in the MD Anderson Neuropsychology database. The relationship between performance on cognitive testing and survival was evaluated using not only Cox proportional hazards models that included clinical factors such as age and KPS but also the Kaplan-Meier method. Median survival time from surgery was 20.7 months. Rates of impairment on cognitive testing ranged from 7.1\% for Similarities, to 60.0\% for Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised Total Recall. As continuous variables, the Clinical Trial Battery Composite, Trail Making Test Part B, and Controlled Oral Word Association test were associated with survival. Impairment on the Trail Making Test Part B, Controlled Oral Word Association, Similarities, and Digit Span were associated with mortality. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated the survival impact of these tests on the group as a whole and in select patient subgroups defined by classification by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA). Cognitive impairment as measured by specific neuropsychological tests is independently associated with poor prognosis in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, and this effect remains significant even within patient subgroups defined by RTOG RPA class. Executive function and attention are the cognitive domains most closely associated with prognosis in this analysis.},
